# sync
Simple directory sync for windows 
Current State: The program syncs files across two folders. It only goes 1 layer deep, and will not copy files inside subfolders. However, it will copy the folder itself. The two folders are currently hardcoded in the first line of main. The program compares two files by filename

Future Roadmap:
-Command line arguments for the two folders.
-Recursion to sync files inside subfolders. 
-Comparison of file contents, not just filename.
